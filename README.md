Buddy Queue is a single web page application that helps find other people to play with in popular MOBAs such as League of Legends, Smite, and Dota (support coming soon).  

Buddy Queue pulls API data from each game and then uses it's own custom algorithm to pair users with other users around their same stat/skill level.
